# Contributing to streamgive-frontend

Thanks for helping out. This guide covers the setup steps specific to this
repo. For the full contribution workflow (branching, PR conventions, design
decisions) see the
[StreamGive docs site](https://github.com/streamgive/streamgive-docs).

## Local setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in any blank vars — see ENVIRONMENT.md
npm install
npm run dev                  # starts on http://localhost:3001
```

The app expects a running `streamgive-backend` instance at
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:3000`). Contract IDs and
the Soroban RPC URL are pre-filled with testnet values so you can start
without deploying contracts yourself.

## Testing

```bash
npm test           # unit + component tests (vitest, single run)
npm run test:e2e   # end-to-end tests (Playwright)
```

`npm test` runs Vitest once (no watch mode) against every `*.test.ts`/
`*.test.tsx` file in `src/`. Config lives in `vitest.config.ts`, which sets
the `jsdom` environment, the `@` path alias (mirroring `tsconfig.json`), and
`test/setup.ts` as a global setup file — that file wires up `jest-dom`'s
matchers and runs Testing Library's `cleanup()` after every test so DOM
state doesn't leak between tests in the same file (this project doesn't use
Vitest's `globals: true`, so that cleanup isn't automatic).

`npm run test:e2e` runs the Playwright specs in `e2e/`. It starts
`npm run dev` for you and points at `http://localhost:3001` unless you set
`E2E_BASE_URL` to an already-running instance (see `playwright.config.ts`).

### Writing a new test

- **Unit/component tests** are colocated with the code they cover, e.g.
  `src/lib/format.ts` → `src/lib/format.test.ts`, and
  `src/components/dashboard/StreamControls.tsx` →
  `src/components/dashboard/StreamControls.test.tsx`. Use
  `@testing-library/react` for components (render, query by role/label,
  fire events) and plain Vitest (`describe`/`it`/`expect`) for pure
  functions. Follow an existing test in the same directory for the
  surrounding conventions (mocking, fixtures, etc).
- **E2E tests** go in `e2e/*.spec.ts` and use Playwright's `test`/`expect`.
  Reserve these for flows that cross multiple pages or need a real browser
  (wallet connection, full donor/NGO flows) — prefer a unit/component test
  when one will do, since the e2e suite is slower and needs a live server.

## Linting and formatting

```bash
npm run lint        # ESLint
npm run format      # Prettier check
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
```

All three run in CI — fix any errors before opening a PR.

## Accessibility checklist

This project has already had a pass of accessibility fixes (color contrast,
live regions for toasts, accessible names on icon-only buttons). When adding
or changing interactive UI, check the following before opening a PR so we
don't regress it:

- **Icon-only controls have an accessible name.** A button with only an
  `<svg>`/icon child needs `aria-label` (see
  `src/components/wallet/ConnectWalletButton.tsx` and
  `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`'s menu toggle). Purely decorative
  icons next to visible text should be `aria-hidden="true"` instead, so
  screen readers don't announce them redundantly.
- **Disclosure widgets expose their state.** A toggle that shows/hides
  content (menus, dropdowns, expandable sections) needs `aria-expanded`,
  and should point `aria-controls` at the id of the region it toggles —
  see `Header.tsx`'s mobile nav toggle.
- **Async status updates use a live region**, not just a visual change —
  toasts, inline form errors, loading/success states. Use
  `role="status"` for non-urgent updates and `role="alert"` for errors
  that need immediate attention (see `src/components/toast/ToastProvider.tsx`).
- **Form controls have a label.** Every `<input>`/`<select>`/`<textarea>`
  needs an associated `<label>` or an `aria-label` when a visible label
  isn't in the design (see the duration `<select>` in
  `src/components/dashboard/StreamControls.tsx`).
- **Color contrast** meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large
  text and UI components) — check new text/background color pairs
  against a contrast checker, particularly for muted/secondary text.
- **Everything reachable is keyboard-operable.** Tab to every new
  interactive element, confirm focus is visible, and confirm it can be
  activated with Enter/Space (or Escape to dismiss, for modals/menus)
  without a mouse.
- **Interactive elements are real elements.** Use `<button>`/`<a>` rather
  than a `<div onClick>` — this gets keyboard support, focus, and role
  semantics for free instead of having to re-implement them.
